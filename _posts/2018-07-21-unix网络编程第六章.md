### io multiplexing:the select and poll functions 

1. why the produce the io multiplexing ?
    we encountered a problem when the client was blocked in a call to fgets(on standard input)and the server process was killed.
the server tcp correctly sent a fin to the client tcp but since the client process was blocked reading from standard input,it never saw the eof 
until it read from the socket (possibly much later).what we neeed is the capability to tell the kernel that we want to be notified if one 
or more i/o conditions are ready .this capability is called io multiplexing and is provided select and poll function.

2. io multiplexing is typically used in networking applications in the following scenarios.
    - when a client is handling multiple descriptor (normally interactive input and a newwork socket),io multiplexing shoulding be used.
    - it is possible,but rare,for a client to handle multiple sockets at the same time.
    - if a tcp server handles both a listening socket and its connected sockets.
    - if a server handles both tcp and udp,io multiplexing is normally used.
    - if a server handles multiple services and perhaps multiple protocol inetd daemon that we will descritor .
io multiplexing is not limited to networking programming ,many nontrivial applications find a need for these techniques.

3. blocking io model
    the most prevalent model for io is the blocking io model,which we have used for all our examples so far in the text.by default
,all socket are blocking .the process callls recvfrom and the system call does not return until the datagram arrives and is copied into our application
buffer,or an error occurs,the most common error is the system call being interrupted by a signal.we say our process is blocked the entire time from when it 
calls recvfrom until it returns .when recvfrom returns successfully,our application processes the datagram.

4. nonblocking io model 
    when we set a socket to be nonblocking ,we are telling the kernel "when an io opoeration that i request can not be completed without putting the process to sleep,do not put the process to sleep,but return an error instead"
when an application sits in a loop calling recvfrom an a nonblocking descriptor like this,it is called polling .

5. io multiplexing model
    with io multiplexing ,we call select or poll and block in one of these two system calls ,instead of blocking in the actual io system call,
we blocking in a call to select,waiting for the datagram socket to be readable,when select return that the socket is readable,wen then call recufrom to copy the datagram into our application buffer.

6. signal driven io model 
    use signal ,tells the kernel to notify us with the sigio signal when the descriptor is ready ,we first enable the socket for signal driven io and install a signal handler using 
the sigaction system call ,the return from this system call is immediate and our process continues,it is not blocked,when the datagram is ready to be read,the sigio signal is generated for our process,we can either read 
the datagram from the signal handler by calling recvfrom and then notify the main loop that the data is ready to be processed .or we can notify the main loop and let it read the datagram.

    regardless of how we handle the signal,the adventage to this model is that we are not blocked while waiting for the datagram to arrive,the main loop can contiue executing and just wait to be notified by the signal handler that either the data is ready to process or the datagram is ready to be read.
7. asynchronous io model 
    the main difference between this model and the signal driven io model in the previous section is that with signal driven io,the kernel tell us when an io operation can be initiated,but with 
asynchronous io,the kernel tells us when an io operation is complete,
    this system call returns immediately and our process is not blocked while waiting for the io to complete,

8. the problem with that earlier version was that we could be blocked in the call to fgets when something happened on the socket ,our new version blocks in a call to select instead,waiting for either standard input or the socket to be readable.

9. the basic concept here is that when a server is handling multiple clients,the server can never block in a function call related to a single client,doing so can hang the server and deny service to all other clients,this is called a denial-of-service attack.
