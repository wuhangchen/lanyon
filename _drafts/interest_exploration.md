Some useful things I forgot to mention (or didn't see written down haha)

When reading cool papers, be sure to list down papers they reference which also seem interesting. Every so often, read one of these instead of papers from a professor/school of inerest. This might turn out to be something you love. It's all about smart random exploration.

For reading papers and keeping track of papers, orginization is CRITICAL. While you can do this manually, a reference manager will save a LOT of time and effort. I highly recommend [paperipile](https://paperpile.com/). Use it to keep track of categories and schools. I recommend having one folder per school she is applying to and labels for broad categories she is interested in. 

One cheat code she can use to see if she's interested in a Professor is to watch videos of their lectures (if available). This is often far easier than reading one of their papers and can be done while eating, washing dishes, etc. 

Subscribe to professors of interest on Google Scholar and check their website every 2 weeks or so.

When summarizing papers, try to have the summary be at least 5 sentences. Try to have at least 3 separate sentences for why you're interested in the paper (they can come from different parts). There isn't a really minimum but minumums help to ensure there's substance.


For GRE, you can find online questions+responses for examples of pointing out flaws in response.


With 3 papers per professor and 5 schools, that's 15 papers (which might be difficult to read). That's in addition to GRE and fellowship apps. This might seem like a lot but if she manages her time well, it won't be! Take a weekend to look at when all of the deadlines for everything are and then spread out applications over many weeks to ensure ample time to get everything done. This will help in avoiding overwhelming moments. A large calendar makes this easy to plan out and adjust as life changes.
