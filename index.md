My name is Wu[^1] Hang Chen and I am an Asia, socially sensitive, aspiring brain and software engineer. I am currently a  Student in Electronic Information Engineering(EE) at the University of Southwest University . Among those which excite me most are :
1. [Learning a programming language,such as C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/) for a programmer,the programming language is very importable,there are many programming language ,but if i select one to study,i never have doubt to study modern C++;
2. [How to study Algorithm](暂时没有简介来介绍) the algorithm is soul of the software.therefor,i would study more ,study well.
3. [jest reading ](名著导读) i think the reading that full of drama,here we can jest more think us,or think our life.


My long term goal is to develop and advance my ability of C++、Linux、reading ,at the same time,reading is my best hobby. 

I am especially interested in how to using modern C++ program the elegant software, so i usually read some book of C++(C++ Primer 5th、effect C++ 、现代C++探秘（编码、工程与科研必修基于C++14）、imperfect in C++ ),of course ,if you also like the elegant language,that we should make a talk about the program language,let we become more well,and you do also.

I am eternally curious. Here are some [questions that keep me up at night]({{ site.baseurl }}/questions) in case you’re interested.
