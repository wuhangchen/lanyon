# The mysterious
Imagine entering a computer science class and sitting next to a young, brown-skinned man. He sits attentively, takes notes, and ask good questions. Once the first exam comes around, you overhear that he scores highly. He seems friendly; interested in meeting him and potentially studying together, you ask him his name. It seems foreign and is unfamiliar. You wonder where it - and this young man - are from and infer a set of "reasonable" predictions.

## How do we do inference on hidden variables?

## How is inference related to social pehenoma like stereotyping?
