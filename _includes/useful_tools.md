# Fields/Tools/Concepts I think will help understand the above

* **bayesian nonparametric methods** for studying principled methods of defining an unbounded set of hidden variables in response to data
  * chinese restaurant process: define an unbounded multinomial distribution (think one hidden variable than can take on one of an increasing set of values)
  * indian buffet process: define an unbounded set of hidden variables (e.g. think a growinggset of the hidden variables mentioned above)
  * why? because there is an infinite set of hidden variables that we can learn! think of traversing through a set of links in wikipedia. each link can either be a new hidden variable (animal, electronic, etc.) or a different value withat that hidden variable (phone, computer, tablet, etc.)
  * theoretical models for cognition using bayesian nonparametric methdods: 
    * paper 1
    * paper 2

* **reinforcement learning**
  * electrophysiological data has implicated TD-learning in the brain
  * there is an increasing body of literature on reinforcement learning in the brain
    * paper 1
    * paper 2

* **artificial neural networks**
  * they recieve a lot of hate for being unprincipled but they are doing 2 things really well
    1. solving REALLY HARD engineerin problems (google machine translation, deepmind wavenet for realistic audio, something else)
    2. providin insight into how neural networks in the brain may work.
      3. dan yamins paper, 1 or 2 more

* **deep reinforcement learning**
  * examples: [atari](atari), [alpha go zero](paper),  

* **large-scale behavioral experiemnts** such as those proposed by [Tom Griffiths](paper)
  * a key part of this will be big-data resources for psychology like [link](to website)
